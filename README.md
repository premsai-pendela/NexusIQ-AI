## What is NexusIQ AI?

NexusIQ AI is a **multi-agent business intelligence system** that answers complex business questions by intelligently combining three data sources:

| Source | What it knows |
|--------|--------------|
| 🗄️ **SQL Database** | 90,500 sales transactions across 2024 — revenue, products, regions, payment methods |
| 📄 **PDF Documents** | 23 internal documents — quarterly reports, strategic plans, compliance policies |
| 🌐 **Live Web** | Real-time competitor pricing scraped from Newegg, IKEA, Campmor, Swanson |

The system routes each question to the right source(s), runs the agents in parallel, cross-validates numeric facts, and returns a single fused answer — with confidence badges showing how well the sources agree.

### Routing Logic

The Fusion Agent uses a two-tier LLM cascade to route every query:

```
Query → Gemini 2.5 Flash (primary, rate-limited)
              │ quota exhausted?
              ▼
         Groq Llama 3.3 70B (fallback)
              │ all sources return false?
              ▼
         "no_data" response (clear message, no hallucination)
```

Six route types:

| Route | When |
|-------|------|
| `sql_only` | Rankings, breakdowns, trends, counts |
| `rag_only` | Policies, strategy, compliance |
| `web_only` | Competitor pricing |
| `sql_rag` | Quarterly/annual revenue (cross-validates PDF reports) |
| `sql_web` / `rag_web` / `all` | Multi-source fusion queries |
| `no_data` | Out-of-range dates, unanswerable queries |

---

## Key Features

**LLM-based query routing** — Gemini 2.5 Flash classifies intent and picks the right combination of agents. Falls back to Groq seamlessly when quota is hit. Shows a warning banner when fallback routing is used.

**SQL Agent with auto-correction** — Converts plain English to SQL via multi-model cascade (Gemini → Groq). Auto-corrects typos ("Wset" → "West", "Electrnics" → "Electronics"). Resolves ambiguity ("best product" → "best product by revenue").

**RAG Agent with hybrid search** — Combines BM25 keyword search + vector embeddings for retrieval. Enters agentic comparison mode for "Compare X vs Y" queries — decomposes into sub-queries, retrieves independently, synthesizes.

**Web Agent with live scraping** — Five competitor scrapers across five product categories:

| Category | Scrapers |
|----------|---------|
| Electronics | Newegg (BeautifulSoup) |
| Home Goods | IKEA (Selenium) |
| Sports | Campmor (Shopify API) |
| Food/Supplements | Swanson, NativePath (Shopify API) |
| Clothing | Taylor Stitch, Chubbies (Shopify API) |

Includes per-scraper status dashboard and cache invalidation for empty results.

**Cross-validation engine** — Extracts dollar amounts from both SQL answer text and PDF content, normalizes formats ($45.2M vs $45,200,000), and computes match confidence within 10% tolerance.

**Chart builder** — Appears automatically on SQL results with numeric data. Supports bar, line, scatter, pie charts with export to CSV / JSON / Excel.

**Automated test runner** — 105 test queries across 8 categories and 3 difficulty levels. Run with `python run_tests.py`.

## Demo

> 🔗 **Live Demo:** *coming soon — link will be added after deployment*

**Example interactions:**

```
"What was Q4 2024 revenue?"
→ sql_rag | SQL: $45.2M | RAG: $45.2M | ✅ HIGH confidence

"Compare Q3 and Q4 2024 performance across all metrics"
→ sql_rag | Agentic decomposition into 3 sub-queries | MEDIUM confidence

"What are competitor prices for electronics?"
→ web_only | Newegg live data | 10 products scraped

"What was revenue in 2020?"
→ no_data | "Data only covers 2024. SQL and RAG cannot answer this."

"Wset region revenue?"
→ Auto-corrected to "West region" | sql_rag | answer returned
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/premsai-pendela/NexusIQ-AI.git
cd NexusIQ-AI

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/sales.db
```

The SQLite database and ChromaDB vector store are pre-built and committed — no generation step needed. Just run:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

To regenerate the database from scratch:

```bash
python database/generate_aligned_data.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501`

---

## Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. Fork / push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) → New app → select this repo
3. Set **Main file path** to `main.py`
4. Open **Advanced settings → Secrets** and paste:

```toml
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key"
GROQ_API_KEY   = "your_groq_api_key"
DATABASE_URL   = "sqlite:///data/sales.db"
```

5. Deploy. The SQLite DB and ChromaDB are pre-committed — no build step required.

> Note: The IKEA Selenium scraper is disabled on Streamlit Cloud (no Chrome). All other scrapers (Shopify API, Newegg BeautifulSoup) work as-is.

## Automated Testing

```bash
# Run all 105 queries
python run_tests.py

# Run by phase
python run_tests.py --phase 1   # Basic functionality (5 queries)
python run_tests.py --phase 2   # Cross-validation (3 queries)
python run_tests.py --phase 3   # Edge cases (5 queries)
python run_tests.py --phase 4   # Advanced multi-source (6 queries)
python run_tests.py --phase 5   # Chart builder SQL (4 queries)

# Run specific queries
python run_tests.py --ids 46,85,91

# Run a section
python run_tests.py --section "SQL ONLY"

# Dry run (print queries without executing)
python run_tests.py --dry-run
```

Reports are saved to `.gstack/test-reports/` as Markdown + JSON.

**Current test results across all 5 phases: 23/23 passing.**
